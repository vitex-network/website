          "How do trading fees work?",
          "There are two types of fee charges:",
          "  1. ViteX charges a Base Trading Fee of 0.2% paid by all traders who use the ViteX platform. ",
          "  2. ViteX Operators running their own Zones may charge an additional fee (\"Operator Fee\") up to 0.2%. In other words, the minimum fees that a trader can pay is 0.2% (Base Trading Fee with no Operator Fee) and the maximum is 0.4% (Base Trading Fee + 0.2% Operator Fee). Operators also reserve the right to adjust their individual Operator Fees.",
          "The above fees are the same for both the makers and the takers.",
          "A trader can choose to stake 10,000 (or 1,000,000) VITE to lower the Base Trading Fee from 0.2% to 0.1% (or 0%). However, any additional Operator fees will remain the same.",
          "All the fees collected from the Base Trading Fee charge will be re-distributed as dividends to VX holders.",

          "Is there token transfer fee?",
          "There are no transfer fee for sending token between the Vite wallet and ViteX.",

          "How do withdrawal fees work?",
          "ViteX's gateways charge withdrawal fees when redeeming cross-chain coins to outside address. The fees will be mainly used for covering transaction cost that may occur on the other blockchain."

Please be noted that limit orders (including partially-matched limit orders) have a 30-day validity period on the order book. Orders over 30 days will be automatically removed by the ViteX contract, and the removed orders due to expiration will show a \"Canceled\" status."

      },
      {
        "question": "Why release VX? Will it affect VITE? What is the relationship between VX and VITE?",
        "answer": [
          "VX can be understood as a “proof-of-equity” on the ViteX platform, which is a standalone application running on the Vite blockchain. ViteX has its own incentive model to encourage user trading. The value of VX is positively related to user and transaction volumes on ViteX. This will not affect the value of VITE. The value of VITE and the Vite chain increases as more dApps are running on it. VITE and VX are connected in many ways. For example, if VITE is staked to obtain certain quotas on ViteX, VX can be earned. The relationship between Vite and ViteX is organic and positively correlative, so are the values."
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a truly decentralized exchange and other exchanges?",
        "answer": [
          "At present, most decentralized exchanges are not truly decentralized as they are limited by the performance of their own public chain. Typically, transactions are performed off-chain and results are shown on-chain.",
          "ViteX is completely decentralized:",
          "  1. The transaction matching engine is performed through smart contracts that run on-chain",
          "  2. The order combinations are all completed on-chain",
          "  3. The order book is stored on-chain",
          "  4. The exchange fee redemption is implemented on-chain. Consequently, the results are fully public and dividend rules cannot be tampered with."

        "question": "Is it safe to put assets in ViteX?",
        "answer": [
          "Absolutely. As a completely decentralized exchange, assets are secured by users' private keys and cannot be misappropriated by others. Tradings take place in smart contracts, which are fully transparent and traceable."
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "The Vite chain has a transaction model without fees. Why does the Vite exchange charge a fee? Is the fee charged by VITE or other tokens?",
        "answer": "Transactions on the Vite chain do not consume gas like those on Ethereum, but another resource referred to as “quota.” Low-frequency traders can reach this quota by solving a simple PoW puzzle on the local device. Since PoW takes a while to complete, this mechanism is suitable for low-frequency usage. On the other hand, to accommodate high-frequency usage, traders will need to stake VITE in order to obtain the required quota. As a high frequency application, ViteX will also consume resources, which will be collected in the form of trading fees on ViteX. Users can choose to stake VITE in order to fill quota on ViteX to lower the trading cost. Trading fees will be paid out through “basic currencies“ such as ETH, BTC, and USDT. Trading fees collected in VITE by ViteX will be burned. "

VX holders can receive daily ViteX Dividends from a shared dividend pool which aggregates all trading fees accumulated by ViteX and redistributes back to VX holders. VX has no pre-sale.

After the burning event, the total VX supply is 29,328,807.8, which will be fully released in 8 years.
